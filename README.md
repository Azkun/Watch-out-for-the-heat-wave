# Watch out for the heat wave
Watch out for the heat wave! These small programs in several languages remind you to drink water every 3 hours!



<h2>What is this project?</h2>
This project is for sensitize everyone so that they drink water regularly because of the heat wave, But also because it's fun to develop it in many languages of development, it's a real challenge for me !
